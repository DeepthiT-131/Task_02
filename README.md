In this Project,
* I have created two Lambda Functions for putting data and retriving data from the dynamodb tables .
* There are two DynamoDb Tables for Teachers data and Student Data 
* Teachers data consists of attributes like TeacherId , Name , Salary , Department , Age .
      Here TeacherId is the Partition Key 
* Student table Consists of StudentId , Name , Department , Age .
      Here StudentId is the partition key.
      
* POST and GET methods of REST API's are used as Endpoints.
